# What is DSA?

**DSA** stands for **Data Structures and Algorithms**.
It is one of the most important parts of programming and computer science.

* **Data Structures (DS)** → A way to store and organize data in memory so that it can be used efficiently.
  Example: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs.

* **Algorithms (A)** → A step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.
  Example: Searching, Sorting, Traversing, Recursion, Dynamic Programming.

Together, **DSA helps us to store data properly and solve problems efficiently.**

# Features of DSA

1. **Efficiency**

   * DSA helps in writing programs that run faster and use less memory.
   * Example: Binary Search (O(log n)) is much faster than Linear Search (O(n)).

2. **Reusability**

   * Once a data structure or algorithm is written, it can be reused in many different problems.

3. **Scalability**

   * DSA allows programs to handle large amounts of data without slowing down too much.
   * Example: Google search engine uses efficient algorithms to search billions of pages in milliseconds.

4. **Optimized Resource Usage**

   * Saves **time complexity** (execution time) and **space complexity** (memory usage).

5. **Problem-Solving Power**

   * DSA gives tools to solve real-world problems like shortest path (Google Maps), searching (Databases), scheduling (Operating Systems), etc.

6. **Foundation of Programming**

   * It is the **backbone** of all major programming fields like Web Development, AI/ML, Cybersecurity, Database Systems, etc.
