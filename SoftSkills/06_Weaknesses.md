**Q. What is your weakness as a coder?**

"Sometimes, I spend too much time **perfecting my code** or focusing on small details, which can slow me down. I’m working on **balancing quality with deadlines**.

Earlier, I also found it difficult to **say 'no' to extra tasks**, but I’m learning to **prioritize my work** better now.

Another weakness I noticed is that I sometimes focus more on **logic than UI design**, but I’m improving by practicing **frontend tools like Tailwind CSS and React**."
