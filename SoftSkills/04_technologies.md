**Q. Which technologies do you most prefer? Front-end or back-end?**

"I enjoy working on both **frontend and backend**, but if I had to choose, I prefer **full-stack development** because it allows me to build **complete solutions**. On the **frontend**, I like working with **React.js, JavaScript, and modern UI tools** to create smooth, user-friendly experiences. On the **backend**, I enjoy working with **Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB or SQL** to ensure the application is secure, scalable, and efficient.

I prefer full-stack because it gives me a **holistic view of the application**â€”from designing what the user interacts with to managing how data is processed and stored. It also makes me more **flexible and capable of handling real-world projects end-to-end**."
