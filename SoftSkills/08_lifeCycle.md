**Q. What is your daily life cycle?**

"My daily life cycle is quite structured. I start my day early with some **exercise or reading**, which keeps me active and focused. After that, I **plan my tasks** for the day.

During work hours, I focus on my responsibilities—**coding, mentoring students, or working on projects**—and I usually divide my work into small goals to stay productive and avoid stress.

In the evening, I spend time **learning new technologies** or improving my skills. I also make sure to spend **quality time with my family** and relax. Before ending the day, I **review my achievements and plan for the next day**.

This routine helps me maintain a healthy balance between **work, learning, and personal life**."
