**Q. What is your strength as a coder?**

"One of my main strengths as a coder is my **problem-solving and logical thinking**. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into smaller parts and finding **efficient solutions**.

I am also **adaptable to new technologies**â€”for example, I quickly learned the **MERN stack** and applied it effectively in real projects.

Another strength is writing **clean and structured code**. I follow best practices to make my code **readable, maintainable, and easy for others to understand**."
