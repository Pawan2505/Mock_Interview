I am also a **good listener and patient**, which helps me in teaching, teamwork, and handling challenges calmly. Another strength is that I am **helpful and supportive**, whether it’s guiding students or collaborating with colleagues."

**Weaknesses:**
"Sometimes, I can be a **perfectionist**, which makes me spend more time on tasks than necessary. I’m learning to **balance quality with efficiency**. I also tend to **avoid asking for help quickly**, as I like solving problems on my own, but I’m improving by being more open to collaboration.
