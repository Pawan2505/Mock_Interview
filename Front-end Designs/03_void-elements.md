**Q: What are void elements? Can you give a few examples?**

**Answer:**
Void elements are HTML tags that **don’t have a closing tag**. You can’t put any content or other tags inside them—they are self-contained.

**Examples:**

* `<img>` – to show images
* `<br>` – to create a line break
* `<hr>` – a horizontal line
* `<input>` – input fields in forms
* `<meta>` – metadata for the page
* `<link>` – links to external resources like CSS
