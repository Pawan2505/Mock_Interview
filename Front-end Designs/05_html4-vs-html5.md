**Q: What are the differences between HTML4 and HTML5?**

**Answer:**

* **Doctype:** HTML4 has a long, complex doctype, while HTML5 is simple: `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
* **Semantic tags:** HTML4 has none, but HTML5 added tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`.
* **Multimedia:** HTML4 needs plugins (Flash), HTML5 supports `<audio>` and `<video>` natively.
* **Forms:** HTML5 adds new input types like `email`, `date`, `number`, `range`.
* **APIs:** HTML5 provides Canvas, Web Storage, Geolocation, Drag & Drop, and WebSockets.
* **Error handling:** HTML5 is more forgiving; HTML4 is strict.
* **Mobile support:** HTML5 is mobile-friendly; HTML4 isnâ€™t optimized for devices.

**Tip:**
"HTML5 is simpler, semantic, mobile-friendly, and supports multimedia and modern APIs, while HTML4 is older and less flexible."
