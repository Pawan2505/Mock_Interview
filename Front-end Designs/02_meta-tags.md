What are meta tags and why are they important for websites?


Meta tags are snippets in the <head> of an HTML page that give information about the website to browsers and search engines. They are important for SEO, responsiveness (viewport), correct text rendering (charset), and controlling how pages appear when shared on social media. In short, they improve visibility, user experience, and compatibility.
