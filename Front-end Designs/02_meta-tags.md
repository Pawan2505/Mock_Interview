**Q: What are meta tags and why are they important for websites?**

**Answer:**
Meta tags are small bits of information we put inside the `<head>` of an HTML page. They tell **browsers and search engines** about the page.

They are important because they help with:

* **SEO** – making your site easier to find on search engines.
* **Responsiveness** – like using `viewport` for mobile devices.
* **Text rendering** – like `charset` for proper display of characters.
* **Social media previews** – controlling how your page looks when shared.

In short, meta tags **make your website work better, look right, and get noticed**.
