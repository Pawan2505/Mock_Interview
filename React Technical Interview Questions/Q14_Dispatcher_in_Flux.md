### **Question 14:** What is a dispatcher?

### **Answer :**

In **Flux architecture**, a **dispatcher** is a **central hub** that manages all data flow in the application.
It **receives actions** and **broadcasts the payload** to all registered callbacks, such as **stores**, so they can update their state accordingly.

The dispatcher ensures that the data flow is **controlled and predictable**, which helps maintain a consistent application state.
