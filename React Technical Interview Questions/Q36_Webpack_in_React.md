### **36) What is the use of Webpack?**

### **Answer:**

**Webpack** is a **module bundler** used in React and modern JavaScript development.
It takes all your project files — like **JavaScript, CSS, images, and other assets** — and **bundles them into a single optimized file** for better performance and easy deployment.

It helps React apps run **faster** and keeps the **code organized and modular**.

### **Example:**

Suppose your app has multiple JavaScript files like:

```
index.js
app.js
helper.js
```

Webpack combines (or *bundles*) them into **one main file** (for example: `bundle.js`), which the browser loads faster.

**Basic Webpack Configuration (webpack.config.js):**

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: "./src/index.js",         // Starting point
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js",         // Final bundled file
    path: __dirname + "/dist",     // Output folder
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      { test: /\.js$/, exclude: /node_modules/, use: "babel-loader" },
    ],
  },
};
```

### **Explanation for Interview:**

* Webpack **bundles** your project files into one optimized output.
* It can also **transform** files using **loaders** (like Babel for JSX/ES6).
* Helps with **code splitting**, **hot reloading**, and **optimization**.
* It’s an essential tool in the React ecosystem for managing large applications.
