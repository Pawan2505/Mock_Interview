### **39) What are the major issues of using MVC architecture in React?**

### **Answer:**

Some major issues of using the **traditional MVC (Model-View-Controller)** architecture in React are:

1. **Expensive DOM Handling:**
   Direct manipulation of the DOM in MVC leads to slower performance compared to Reactâ€™s virtual DOM.

2. **Reduced Efficiency:**
   As applications grow larger, managing updates and synchronization between the model and view becomes complex and inefficient.

3. **Complex Dependencies:**
   There can be circular dependencies between models and views, making debugging and maintenance difficult.

### ðŸ’¡ **In React:**

React solves many of these problems by using a **component-based architecture** and **virtual DOM**, which make updates faster and the structure easier to manage.
