### **Question 7:** Define the term Redux in React.

### **Answer:**

**Redux** is a **JavaScript library** used for **state management** in front-end applications.
It helps you store and manage the entire application’s state in one central place called the **store**.
This makes it easier to share data between components and keep the app’s behavior predictable.

Redux can be used with **React** or any other JavaScript framework. You can also **test and run** applications built with Redux in different environments because the state is handled in a consistent way.
