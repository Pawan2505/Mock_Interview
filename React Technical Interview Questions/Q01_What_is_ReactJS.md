1) What is Reactjs?


ReactJS is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces or UI components.
It follows a component-based architecture, which allows developers to break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces.
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) that helps improve performance by updating only the parts of the page that change, instead of reloading the whole page.

Itâ€™s mainly used for building single-page applications (SPAs) where data changes dynamically without reloading the entire page.
