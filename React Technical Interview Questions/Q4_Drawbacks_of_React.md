Question 4: Give me two most significant drawbacks of React.


Difficult to set up with other frameworks:
It can be a bit tricky to integrate React with traditional MVC frameworks like Rails or Django. You need to do some extra configuration to make everything work smoothly.

Takes time to learn:
React is not very beginner-friendly. To use it properly, you need to understand concepts like components, states, props, and how to connect React with other parts of your project. So, the learning curve can be a little steep at first.
