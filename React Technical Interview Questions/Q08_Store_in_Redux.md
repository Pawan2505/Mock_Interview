### **Question 8:** What is the 'Store' feature in Redux?

### **Answer (Human & Natural Version):**

In **Redux**, the **Store** is a special object that holds the **entire state of the application** in one central place.
Instead of each component managing its own state separately, all components share data from the **Store**.

This makes it easier to **manage, update, and track changes** in the app.
The Store sends updates directly to components whenever the state changes.
Having a **single state tree** also helps developers **debug, inspect, and maintain** the application more easily.

### ⚙️ **Key Points to Mention in Interview:**

* The **Store** holds the **complete application state**.
* Ensures **one source of truth** for all components.
* Provides **regular updates** to components.
* Makes debugging and state tracking **much easier**.
* Supports the **unidirectional data flow** pattern.
