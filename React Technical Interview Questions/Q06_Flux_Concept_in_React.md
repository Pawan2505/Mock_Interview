### **Question 6:** What is the Flux concept in React?

### **Answer :**

Flux is an **architecture pattern** introduced by **Facebook** for building **client-side web applications**.
It is **not a framework or library**, but a **design pattern** that helps manage how data flows in a React application.

Flux follows the idea of **unidirectional data flow**, which means data moves in **one direction** — making applications easier to understand and debug.
It works perfectly with React, ensuring that the UI always stays in sync with the application data.
