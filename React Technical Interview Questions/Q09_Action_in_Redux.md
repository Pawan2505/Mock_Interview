### **Question 9:** What is an action in Redux?

### **Answer :**

In **Redux**, an **action** is a **plain JavaScript object** that describes **what happened** in the application.
Each action must have a **type** property that tells the Store what kind of change to perform. It can also include **data (payload)** needed for that change.

Actions are the **only way** to send information from the **application to the Store**.
They act as a messenger between the components and the Store, helping update the state in a predictable way.
