### **Question 11:** Explain the term stateless components

### **Answer :**

**Stateless components** in React are components that **do not manage their own state**.
They are **pure functions** that receive **props** from their parent component and render the UI based only on those props.

Since they donâ€™t have internal state, they are **simpler, easier to read, and faster** compared to stateful components.
