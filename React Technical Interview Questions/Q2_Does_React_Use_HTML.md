Question 2: Does React use HTML?


No, React does not use regular HTML.
Instead, it uses JSX (JavaScript XML) — a syntax extension of JavaScript that looks very similar to HTML.

JSX allows developers to write HTML-like code inside JavaScript, making it easier to create and visualize UI components.
Although it looks like HTML, JSX is not real HTML — it gets compiled into JavaScript using tools like Babel before being rendered to the DOM.
