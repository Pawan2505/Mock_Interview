### **Question 13:** Explain JSX

### **Answer :**

**JSX (JavaScript XML)** is a **syntax extension for JavaScript** that React uses to describe what the **UI should look like**.
It looks very similar to HTML, but itâ€™s actually **JavaScript under the hood**.

JSX makes it easier to **write and visualize components** because you can define your UI structure right inside your JavaScript code. Before running in the browser, JSX is **transformed into standard JavaScript** by tools like **Babel**.
